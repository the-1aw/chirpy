# Improvements
- [ ] Make the README decent
- [ ] Add a seeding mechanism (through /reset ?) to have initial testing data
- [ ] Add autogenerated documentation (godoc or swagger)
- [ ] Refactor current api with chi to see how it can ease the development
- [ ] Creata a clone of the api with a framework like gin or echo to see it's worth it
- [ ] See how it can be deployed
- [ ] Add a web client (htmx or templ)
